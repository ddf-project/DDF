anarchism originated as a term of abuse first used against early working class radicals including the
diggers of the english revolution and the sans culottes of the french revolution whilst the term
is still used in a pejorative way to describe any act that used violent means to
destroy the organization of society it has also been taken up as a positive label by
self defined anarchists the word anarchism is derived from the greek without archons ruler chief king
anarchism as a political philosophy is the belief that rulers are unnecessary and should be abolished
although there are differing interpretations of what this means anarchism also refers to related social movements
that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions particularly the state the word anarchy as most anarchists
use it does not imply chaos nihilism or anomie but rather a harmonious anti authoritarian society
in place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions anarchists advocate
social relations based upon voluntary association of autonomous individuals mutual aid and self governance while anarchism
is most easily defined by what it is against anarchists also offer positive visions of what
they believe to be a truly free society however ideas about how an anarchist society might
work vary considerably especially with respect to economics there is also disagreement about how a free
society might be brought about origins and predecessors kropotkin and others argue that before recorded history
human society was organized on anarchist principles most anthropologists follow kropotkin and engels in believing that
hunter gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour accumulated wealth or decreed law and
had equal access to resources william godwin anarchists including the the anarchy organisation and rothbard find
anarchist attitudes in taoism from ancient china kropotkin found similar ideas in stoic zeno of citium
according to kropotkin zeno repudiated the omnipotence of the state its intervention and regimentation and proclaimed
the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual the anabaptists of one six th century
europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism bertrand russell in his history
of western philosophy writes that the anabaptists repudiated all law since they held that the good
man will be guided at every moment by the holy spirit from this premise they arrive
at communism the diggers or true levellers were an early communistic movement during the time of
the english civil war and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism in the
modern era the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was louis
armand baron de lahontan in his nouveaux voyages dans l am rique septentrionale one seven zero
three where he described the indigenous american society which had no state laws prisons priests or
private property as being in anarchy russell means a libertarian and leader in the american indian
movement has repeatedly stated that he is an anarchist and so are all his ancestors in
one seven nine three in the thick of the french revolution william godwin published an enquiry
concerning political justice although godwin did not use the word anarchism many later anarchists have regarded
this book as the first major anarchist text and godwin as the founder of philosophical anarchism
but at this point no anarchist movement yet existed and the term anarchiste was known mainly
as an insult hurled by the bourgeois girondins at more radical elements in the french revolution
the first self labelled anarchist pierre joseph proudhon it is commonly held that it wasn t
until pierre joseph proudhon published what is property in one eight four zero that the term
anarchist was adopted as a self description it is for this reason that some claim proudhon
as the founder of modern anarchist theory in what is property proudhon answers with the famous
accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t
where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish such as
exploiting workers for profit in its place proudhon supported what he called possession individuals can have
limited rights to use resources capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice
proudhon s vision of anarchy which he called mutualism mutuellisme involved an exchange economy where individuals
and groups could trade the products of their labor using labor notes which represented the amount
of working time involved in production this would ensure that no one would profit from the
labor of others workers could freely join together in co operative workshops an interest free bank
would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production proudhon s
ideas were influential within french working class movements and his followers were active in the revolution
of one eight four eight in france proudhon s philosophy of property is complex it was
developed in a number of works over his lifetime and there are differing interpretations of some
of his ideas for more detailed discussion see here max stirner s egoism in his the
ego and its own stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions including the notion of
state property as a right natural rights in general and the very notion of society were
mere illusions or ghosts in the mind saying of society that the individuals are its reality
he advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in associations of
egoists only when it was in their self interest to do so for him property simply
comes about through might whoever knows how to take to defend the thing to him belongs
property and what i have in my power that is my own so long as i
assert myself as holder i am the proprietor of the thing stirner never called himself an
anarchist he accepted only the label egoist nevertheless his ideas were influential on many individualistically inclined
anarchists although interpretations of his thought are diverse american individualist anarchism benjamin tucker in one eight
two five josiah warren had participated in a communitarian experiment headed by robert owen called new
harmony which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict warren blamed the community s
failure on a lack of individual sovereignty and a lack of private property warren proceeded to
organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called the sovereignty of the individual at utopia
and modern times in one eight three three warren wrote and published the peaceful revolutionist which
some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published benjamin tucker says that warren
was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism liberty xiv
december one nine zero zero one benjamin tucker became interested in anarchism through meeting josiah warren
and william b greene he edited and published liberty from august one eight eight one to
april one nine zero eight it is widely considered to be the finest individualist anarchist periodical
ever issued in the english language tucker s conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of
a variety of theorists greene s ideas on mutual banking warren s ideas on cost as
the limit of price a heterodox variety of labour theory of value proudhon s market anarchism
max stirner s egoism and herbert spencer s law of equal freedom tucker strongly supported the
individual s right to own the product of his or her labour as private property and
believed in a market economy for trading this property he argued that in a truly free
market system without the state the abundance of competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all
workers received the full value of their labor other one nine th century individualists included lysander
spooner stephen pearl andrews and victor yarros the first international mikhail bakunin one eight one four
one eight seven six in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight
twenty years later in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the
first international united some diverse european revolutionary currents including anarchism due to its genuine links to
active workers movements the international became signficiant from the start karl marx was a leading figure
in the international he was elected to every succeeding general council of the association the first
objections to marx came from the mutualists who opposed communism and statism shortly after mikhail bakunin
and his followers joined in one eight six eight the first international became polarised into two
camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads the clearest difference between the camps was
over strategy the anarchists around bakunin favoured in kropotkin s words direct economical struggle against capitalism
without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation at that time marx and his followers focused on
parliamentary activity bakunin characterised marx s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that if a marxist party
gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had
fought against in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the
two groups at the hague congress this is often cited as the origin of the conflict
between anarchists and marxists from this moment the social democratic and libertarian currents of socialism had
distinct organisations including rival internationals anarchist communism peter kropotkin proudhon and bakunin both opposed communism associating
it with statism however in the one eight seven zero s many anarchists moved away from
bakunin s economic thinking called collectivism and embraced communist concepts communists believed the means of production
should be owned collectively and that goods be distributed by need not labor an early anarchist
communist was joseph d jacque the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he
argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has
a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their
nature he announced his ideas in his us published journal le libertaire one eight five eight
one eight six one peter kropotkin often seen as the most important theorist outlined his economic
ideas in the conquest of bread and fields factories and workshops he felt co operation is
more beneficial than competition illustrated in nature in mutual aid a factor of evolution one eight
nine seven subsequent anarchist communists include emma goldman and alexander berkman many in the anarcho syndicalist
movements see below saw anarchist communism as their objective isaac puente s one nine three two
comunismo libertario was adopted by the spanish cnt as its manifesto for a post revolutionary society
some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property
was not consistent with liberty for example benjamin tucker whilst professing respect for kropotkin and publishing
his work described communist anarchism as pseudo anarchism propaganda of the deed johann most was an
outspoken advocate of violence anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent due mainly to
a number of high profile violent acts including riots assassinations insurrections and terrorism by some anarchists
some revolutionaries of the late one nine th century encouraged acts of political violence such as
bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism such actions have sometimes been
called propaganda by the deed one of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was johann
most who said the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation
of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion
most s preferred method of terrorism dynamite earned him the moniker dynamost however there is no
consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general mikhail bakunin and errico malatesta for
example wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings but at
the same time they denounced acts of individual terrorism malatesta in on violence and bakunin when
he refuted nechaev other anarchists sometimes identified as pacifist anarchists advocated complete nonviolence leo tolstoy whose
philosophy is often viewed as a form of christian anarchism see below was a notable exponent
of nonviolent resistance anarchism in the labour movement the red and black flag coming from the
experience of anarchists in the labour movement is particularly associated with anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalism was
an early two zero th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state
to institute a worker controlled society the movement pursued industrial actions such as general strike as
a primary strategy many anarcho syndicalists believed in anarchist communism though not all communists believed in
syndicalism after the one eight seven one repression french anarchism reemerged influencing the bourses de travails
of autonomous workers groups and trade unions from this movement the conf d ration g n
rale du travail general confederation of work cgt was formed in one eight nine five as
the first major anarcho syndicalist movement emile pataud and emile pouget s writing for the cgt
saw libertarian communism developing from a general strike after one nine one four the cgt moved
away from anarcho syndicalism due to the appeal of bolshevism french style syndicalism was a significant
movement in europe prior to one nine two one and remained a significant movement in spain
until the mid one nine four zero s the industrial workers of the world iww founded
in one nine zero five in the us espoused unionism and sought a general strike to
usher in a stateless society in one nine two three one zero zero zero zero zero

nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in one nine one zero prior to
the one nine four zero s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class
politics with a membership of one five eight million in one nine three four the cnt
played a major role in the spanish civil war see also anarchism in spain syndicalists like
ricardo flores mag n were key figures in the mexican revolution latin american anarchism was strongly
influenced extending to the zapatista rebellion and the factory occupation movements in argentina in berlin in
one nine two two the cnt was joined with the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist
successor to the first international contemporary anarcho syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities
much smaller than in the one nine one zero s two zero s and three zero

n general del trabajo and the cnt the cgt claims a paid up membership of six

syndicalist movements include the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation the revolutionary industrial
unionist industrial workers of the world also exists claiming two zero zero zero paid members contemporary
critics of anarcho syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are workerist and fail to
deal with economic life outside work post leftist critics such as bob black claim anarcho syndicalism
advocates oppressive social structures such as work and the workplace anarcho syndicalists in general uphold principles
of workers solidarity direct action and self management the russian revolution the russian revolution of one
nine one seven was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and
as a philosophy anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions many anarchists
initially supporting the bolshevik coup however the bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left
wing opposition a conflict which culminated in the one nine one eight kronstadt rebellion anarchists in
central russia were imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks in ukraine anarchists fought
in the civil war against both whites and bolsheviks within the makhnovshchina peasant army led by
nestor makhno expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman before leaving russia were amongst those
agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising both wrote classic
accounts of their experiences in russia aiming to expose the reality of bolshevik control for them
bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule had proved all too true the victory
of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage
to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist
parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the us
for example the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww began to realign themselves away
from anarchism and towards the communist international in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist
exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in
response to the structures of bolshevism their one nine two six manifesto known as the organisational
platform of the libertarian communists was supported by some communist anarchists though opposed by many others
the platform continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised
around its principles of theoretical unity tactical unity collective responsibility and federalism platformist groups today include
the workers solidarity movement in ireland the uk s anarchist federation and the late north eastern
federation of anarchist communists in the northeastern united states and bordering canada the fight against fascism
spain one nine three six members of the cnt construct armoured cars to fight against the
fascists in one of the collectivised factories in the one nine two zero s and one
nine three zero s the familiar dynamics of anarchism s conflict with the state were transformed
by the rise of fascism in europe in many cases european anarchists faced difficult choices should
they join in popular fronts with reformist democrats and soviet led communists against a common fascist
enemy luigi fabbri an exile from italian fascism was amongst those arguing that fascism was something
different fascism is not just another form of government which like all others uses violence it
is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable it represents the utmost
glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority in france where the fascists
came close to insurrection in the february one nine three four riots anarchists divided over a
united front policy in spain the cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance
and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory but in one nine
three six the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back
to power months later the ruling class responded with an attempted coup and the spanish civil
war one nine three six three nine was underway in reponse to the army rebellion an
anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of the major
city of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivized the land but
even before the eventual fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground
in a bitter struggle with the stalinists the cnt leadership often appeared confused and divided with
some members controversially entering the government stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident
marxists and anarchists since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists have been involved in
fighting the rise of neo fascist groups in germany and the united kingdom some anarchists worked
within militant anti fascist groups alongside members of the marxist left they advocated directly combating fascists
with physical force rather than relying on the state since the late one nine nine zero
s a similar tendency has developed within us anarchism see also anti racist action us anti
fascist action uk antifa religious anarchism leo tolstoy one eight two eight one nine one zero
most anarchist culture tends to be secular if not outright anti religious however the combination of
religious social conscience historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes and the compatibility of some interpretations of
religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism christian anarchists believe that there is no
higher authority than god and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches they believe
that jesus teachings were clearly anarchistic but were corrupted when christianity was declared the official religion
of rome christian anarchists who follow jesus directive to turn the other cheek are strict pacifists
the most famous advocate of christian anarchism was leo tolstoy author of the kingdom of god
is within you who called for a society based on compassion nonviolent principles and freedom christian
anarchists tend to form experimental communities they also occasionally resist taxation many christian anarchists are vegetarian
or vegan christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion s
birth as the early church exhibits many anarchistic tendencies such as communal goods and wealth by
aiming to obey utterly certain of the bible s teachings certain anabaptist groups of sixteenth century
europe attempted to emulate the early church s social economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it
as the only social structure capable of true obediance to jesus teachings and utterly rejected in
theory all earthly hierarchies and authority and indeed non anabaptists in general and violence as ungodly
such groups for example the hutterites typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to as their movements
stabalised more authoritarian social models chinese anarchism was most influential in the one nine two zero
s strands of chinese anarchism included tai xu s buddhist anarchism which was influenced by tolstoy
and the well field system neopaganism with its focus on the environment and equality along with
its often decentralized nature has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists one of the most
prominent is starhawk who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism anarchism and feminism emma goldman
early french feminists such as jenny d h ricourt and juliette adam criticised the mysogyny in
the anarchism of proudhon during the one eight five zero s anarcha feminism is a kind
of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society while
anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years its explicit formulation as anarcha feminism
dates back to the early seven zero s during the second wave feminist movement anarcha feminism
views patriarchy as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history thus the first form of
oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female anarcha feminists then conclude that if feminists
are against patriarchy they must also be against all forms of hierarchy and therefore must reject
the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism anarcho primitivists see the creation of gender roles
and patriarchy a creation of the start of civilization and therefore consider primitivism to also be
an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns eco feminism is often considered a feminist
variant of green anarchist feminist thought anarcha feminism is most often associated with early two zero
th century authors and theorists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre although even early
first wave feminist mary wollstonecraft held proto anarchist views and william godwin is often considered a
feminist anarchist precursor it should be noted that goldman and de cleyre though they both opposed
the state had opposing philosophies as de cleyre explains miss goldman is a communist i am
an individualist she wishes to destroy the right of property i wish to assert it i
make my war upon privilege and authority whereby the right of property the true right in
that which is proper to the individual is annihilated she believes that co operation would entirely
supplant competition i hold that competition in one form or another will always exist and that
it is highly desirable it should in the spanish civil war an anarcha feminist group free
women organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas in the modern day anarchist movement many
anarchists male or female consider themselves feminists and anarcha feminist ideas are growing the publishing of
quiet rumors an anarcha feminist reader has helped to spread various kinds of anti authoritarian and
anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement wendy mcelroy has popularized an individualist anarchism take on
feminism in her books articles and individualist feminist website anarcho capitalism murray rothbard one nine two
six one nine nine five anarcho capitalism is a predominantly united states based theoretical tradition that
desires a stateless society with the economic system of free market capitalism unlike other branches of
anarchism it does not oppose profit or capitalism consequently most anarchists do not recognise anarcho capitalism
as a form of anarchism murray rothbard s synthesis of classical liberalism and austrian economics was
germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho capitalist theory he defines anarcho capitalism in terms of
the non aggression principle based on the concept of natural law competiting theorists use egoism utilitarianism
used by david friedman or contractarianism used by jan narveson some minarchists such as ayn rand
robert nozick and robert a heinlein have influenced anarcho capitalism some anarcho capitalists along with some
right wing libertarian historians such as david hart and ralph raico considered similar philosophies existing prior
to rothbard to be anarcho capitalist such as those of gustave de molinari and auberon herbert
opponents of anarcho capitalists dispute these claims the place of anarcho capitalism within anarchism and indeed
whether it is a form of anarchism at all is highly controversial for more on this
debate see anarchism and anarcho capitalism anarchism and the environment since the late one nine seven
zero s anarchists in anglophone and european countries have been taking action for the natural environment
eco anarchists or green anarchists believe in deep ecology this is a worldview that embraces biodiversity
and sustainability eco anarchists often use direct action against what they see as earth destroying institutions
of particular importance is the earth first movement that takes action such as tree sitting another
important component is ecofeminism which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination
of women green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists
civilization itself primitivism is a predominantly western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre industrial
and usually pre agricultural society it develops a critique of industrial civilization in this critique technology
and development have alienated people from the natural world this philosophy develops themes present in the
political action of the luddites and the writings of jean jacques rousseau primitivism developed in the
context of the reclaim the streets earth first and the earth liberation front movements john zerzan
wrote that civilization not just the state would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved
anarcho primitivists point to the anti authoritarian nature of many primitive or hunter gatherer societies throughout
the world s history as examples of anarchist societies other branches and offshoots anarchism generates many
eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements since the western social formet in the one nine six
zero s and one nine seven zero s a number new of movements and schools have
appeared most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements
listed above hakim bey post left anarchy post left anarchy also called egoist anarchism seeks to
distance itself from the traditional left communists liberals social democrats etc and to escape the confines
of ideology in general post leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment
to contrary leftist movements and single issue causes anti war anti nuclear etc it calls for
a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist
milieu it often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other
broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of explicit hierarchy important

receiving popular attention in his book from bakunin to lacan to refer to a theoretical move
towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought subsequent to newman s use of
the term however it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range
of ideas including autonomism post left anarchy situationism post colonialism and zapatismo by its very nature
post anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs

the term in opposition to big a anarchism in the article anarchism ideology or methodology while
big a anarchism referred to ideological anarchists small a anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts
those who viewed anarchism as a way of acting or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority
as an anti ideological position small a anarchism shares some similarities with post left anarchy david
graeber and andrej grubacic offer an alternative use of the term applying it to groups and
movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation voluntary
association mutual aid the network model and crucially the rejection of any idea that the end
justifies the means let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power
and then begin imposing one s vision at the point of a gun other issues conceptions
of an anarchist society many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of
regulating violence so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are
established anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state
many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the cause of chaos violence
and war anarchists argue that the state helps to create a monopoly on violence and uses
violence to advance elite interests much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would
handle criminality see also anarchism and society civil rights and cultural sovereignty black anarchism opposes the
existence of a state capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of color and favors a
non hierarchical organization of society theorists include ashanti alston lorenzo komboa ervin and sam mbah anarchist
people of color was created as a forum for non caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts
about racial issues within the anarchist movement particularly within the united states national anarchism is a
political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views its adherents propose
that those preventing ethnic groups or races from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted
anti racist action is not an anarchist group but many anarchists are involved it focuses on
publicly confronting racist agitators the zapatista movement of chiapas mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with
some anarchist proclivities neocolonialism and globalization nearly all anarchists oppose neocolonialism as an attempt to use
economic coercion on a global scale carried out through state institutions such as the world bank
world trade organization group of eight and the world economic forum globalization is an ambiguous term
that has different meanings to different anarchist factions most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism
and or cultural imperialism which they may see as related many are active in the anti
globalization movement others particularly anarcho capitalists use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division
of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene
parallel structures many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state supported institutions and outposts such
as food not bombs infoshops educational systems such as home schooling neighborhood mediation arbitration groups and
so on the idea is to create the structures for a new anti authoritarian society in
the shell of the old authoritarian one technology recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause
both easier to advance and more conceivable to people many people use the internet to form
on line communities intellectual property is undermined and a gift culture supported by sharing music files
open source programming and the free software movement these cyber communities include the gnu linux indymedia
and wiki some anarchists see information technology as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism some even
think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable see also crypto anarchism and cypherpunk pacifism some
anarchists consider pacifism opposition to war to be inherent in their philosophy anarcho pacifists take it
further and follow leo tolstoy s belief in non violence anarchists see war as an activity
in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power both domestically and in foreign lands
and subscribe to randolph bourne s view that war is the health of the state a
lot of anarchist activity has been anti war based parliamentarianism in general terms the anarchist ethos

anarchists an oxymoron or what by joe peacott and writings by fred woodworth sectarianism most anarchist
schools of thought are to some degree sectarian there is often a difference of opinion within
each school about how to react to or interact with other schools some such as panarchists
believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and
compete some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction others see opportunities
for coalition building or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes see anarchism without adjectives criticisms
of anarchism main article criticisms of anarchism violence since anarchism has often been associated with violence
and destruction some people have seen it as being too violent on the other hand hand
frederick engels criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough a revolution is certainly the most authoritarian
thing there is it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will
upon the other part by means of rifles bayonets and cannon authoritarian means if such there
be at all and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain
it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the
reactionists would the paris commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use
of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois utopianism anarchism is often criticised as
unfeasible or plain utopian even by many who agree that it s a nice idea in
principle for example carl landauer in his book european socialism criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian
and holds that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he holds
that the belief that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however
it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism for
example some such as benjamin tucker advocate privately funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property
however other anarchists such as sir herbert read proudly accept the characterization utopian class character marxists
have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the petite bourgeoisie or perhaps
the lumpenproletariat see e g plekhanov for a marxist critique of one eight nine five anarchists
have also been characterised as spoilt middle class dilettantes most recently in relation to anti capitalist
protesters tacit authoritarianism in recent decades anarchism has been criticised by situationists post anarchists and others
of preserving tacitly statist authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade hypocrisy some critics point
to the sexist and racist views of some prominent anarchists notably proudhon and bakunin as examples
of hypocrisy inherent within anarchism while many anarchists however dismiss that the personal prejudices of one
nine th century theorists influence the beliefs of present day anarchists others criticise modern anarchism for
continuing to be eurocentric and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like proudhon on fascism through
groups like cercle proudhon anarcho capitalist bryan caplan argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected
fascist sympathizers by spanish anarchists in the spanish civil war was a form of illegitimate coercion
making the proffessed anarchists ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians alongside the communists and fascists
he also criticizes the willingness of the cnt to join the statist republican government during the
civil war and references stanley g payne s book on the franco regime which claims that
the cnt entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war cultural phenomena noam

styles anarchism rose in popularity most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has
been punk rock although in the modern age hip hop and folk music are also becoming
important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message in the uk this was associated with
the punk rock movement the band crass is celebrated for its anarchist and pacifist ideas the

anarchism forms of government political ideology entry points political theories social philosophy autism is classified as
a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction communication ability patterns of interests
and patterns of behavior although the specific etiology of autism is unknown many researchers suspect that
autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers and while there is disagreement about the
magnitude nature and mechanisms for such environmental factors researchers have found at least seven major genes
prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one
united states child in one six six however the national institute of mental health gives a
more conservative estimate of one in one zero zero zero for families that already have one
autistic child the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in
twenty diagnosis is based on a list of psychiatric criteria and a series of standardized clinical
tests may also be used autism may not be physiologically obvious a complete physical and neurological
evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism some now speculate that autism is not a
single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways by definition
autism must manifest delays in social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or
imaginative play with onset prior to age three years according to the diagnostic and statistical manual
of mental disorders the icd one zero also says that symptoms must manifest before the age
of three years there have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism for reasons
that are heavily debated by researchers in psychology and related fields within the scientific community some
children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can
fully participate in mainstream education and social events but there are lingering concerns that an absolute
cure from autism is impossible with current technology however many autistic children and adults who are
able to communicate at least in writing are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions and
see such conditions as part of who they are history dr hans asperger described a form
of autism in the one nine four zero s that later became known as asperger s
syndrome the word autism was first used in the english language by swiss psychiatrist eugene bleuler
in a one nine one two number of the american journal of insanity it comes from
the greek word for self however the classification of autism did not occur until the middle
of the twentieth century when in one nine four three psychiatrist dr leo kanner of the
johns hopkins hospital in baltimore reported on one one child patients with striking behavioral similarities and
introduced the label early infantile autism he suggested autism from the greek autos meaning self to
describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people although kanner s
first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal the nervous child almost
every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders
at the same time an austrian scientist dr hans asperger described a different form of autism
that became known as asperger s syndrome but the widespread recognition of asperger s work was
delayed by world war ii in germany and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn
t translated into english for almost five zero years the majority of his work wasn t
widely read until one nine nine seven thus these two conditions were described and are today
listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr fourth edition text
revision one as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd more often referred to today
as autism spectrum disorders asd all of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference
in communication skills social interactions and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior few clinicians today
solely use the dsm iv criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism which are based on
the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones many clinicians instead use an alternate means or
a combination thereof to more accurately determine a diagnosis terminology when referring to someone diagnosed with
autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used
instead this is referred to as person first terminology the autistic community generally prefers the term
autistic for reasons that are fairly controversial this article uses the term autistic see talk page
characteristics dr leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three there
is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic and physicians
will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis much of this is due to
the sensory system of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other
people since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non autistic and the degree
to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another nevertheless
professionals within pediatric care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to
initiate treatment as early as possible however some people do not believe in treatment for autism
either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can
do more harm than good social development typically developing infants are social beings early in life
they do such things as gaze at people turn toward voices grasp a finger and even
smile in contrast most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty
learning to engage in the give and take of everyday human interaction even in the first
few months of life many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and
anarchism originated as a term of abuse first used against early working class radicals including the
diggers of the english revolution and the sans culottes of the french revolution whilst the term
is still used in a pejorative way to describe any act that used violent means to
destroy the organization of society it has also been taken up as a positive label by
self defined anarchists the word anarchism is derived from the greek without archons ruler chief king
anarchism as a political philosophy is the belief that rulers are unnecessary and should be abolished
although there are differing interpretations of what this means anarchism also refers to related social movements
that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions particularly the state the word anarchy as most anarchists
use it does not imply chaos nihilism or anomie but rather a harmonious anti authoritarian society
in place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions anarchists advocate
social relations based upon voluntary association of autonomous individuals mutual aid and self governance while anarchism
is most easily defined by what it is against anarchists also offer positive visions of what
they believe to be a truly free society however ideas about how an anarchist society might
work vary considerably especially with respect to economics there is also disagreement about how a free
society might be brought about origins and predecessors kropotkin and others argue that before recorded history
human society was organized on anarchist principles most anthropologists follow kropotkin and engels in believing that
hunter gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour accumulated wealth or decreed law and
had equal access to resources william godwin anarchists including the the anarchy organisation and rothbard find
anarchist attitudes in taoism from ancient china kropotkin found similar ideas in stoic zeno of citium
according to kropotkin zeno repudiated the omnipotence of the state its intervention and regimentation and proclaimed
the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual the anabaptists of one six th century
europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism bertrand russell in his history
of western philosophy writes that the anabaptists repudiated all law since they held that the good
man will be guided at every moment by the holy spirit from this premise they arrive
at communism the diggers or true levellers were an early communistic movement during the time of
the english civil war and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism in the
modern era the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was louis
armand baron de lahontan in his nouveaux voyages dans l am rique septentrionale one seven zero
three where he described the indigenous american society which had no state laws prisons priests or
private property as being in anarchy russell means a libertarian and leader in the american indian
movement has repeatedly stated that he is an anarchist and so are all his ancestors in
one seven nine three in the thick of the french revolution william godwin published an enquiry
concerning political justice although godwin did not use the word anarchism many later anarchists have regarded
this book as the first major anarchist text and godwin as the founder of philosophical anarchism
but at this point no anarchist movement yet existed and the term anarchiste was known mainly
as an insult hurled by the bourgeois girondins at more radical elements in the french revolution
the first self labelled anarchist pierre joseph proudhon it is commonly held that it wasn t
until pierre joseph proudhon published what is property in one eight four zero that the term
anarchist was adopted as a self description it is for this reason that some claim proudhon
as the founder of modern anarchist theory in what is property proudhon answers with the famous
accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t
where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish such as
exploiting workers for profit in its place proudhon supported what he called possession individuals can have
limited rights to use resources capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice
proudhon s vision of anarchy which he called mutualism mutuellisme involved an exchange economy where individuals
and groups could trade the products of their labor using labor notes which represented the amount
of working time involved in production this would ensure that no one would profit from the
labor of others workers could freely join together in co operative workshops an interest free bank
would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production proudhon s
ideas were influential within french working class movements and his followers were active in the revolution
of one eight four eight in france proudhon s philosophy of property is complex it was
developed in a number of works over his lifetime and there are differing interpretations of some
of his ideas for more detailed discussion see here max stirner s egoism in his the
ego and its own stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions including the notion of
state property as a right natural rights in general and the very notion of society were
mere illusions or ghosts in the mind saying of society that the individuals are its reality
he advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in associations of
egoists only when it was in their self interest to do so for him property simply
comes about through might whoever knows how to take to defend the thing to him belongs
property and what i have in my power that is my own so long as i
assert myself as holder i am the proprietor of the thing stirner never called himself an
anarchist he accepted only the label egoist nevertheless his ideas were influential on many individualistically inclined
anarchists although interpretations of his thought are diverse american individualist anarchism benjamin tucker in one eight
two five josiah warren had participated in a communitarian experiment headed by robert owen called new
harmony which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict warren blamed the community s
failure on a lack of individual sovereignty and a lack of private property warren proceeded to
organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called the sovereignty of the individual at utopia
and modern times in one eight three three warren wrote and published the peaceful revolutionist which
some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published benjamin tucker says that warren
was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism liberty xiv
december one nine zero zero one benjamin tucker became interested in anarchism through meeting josiah warren
and william b greene he edited and published liberty from august one eight eight one to
april one nine zero eight it is widely considered to be the finest individualist anarchist periodical
ever issued in the english language tucker s conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of
a variety of theorists greene s ideas on mutual banking warren s ideas on cost as
the limit of price a heterodox variety of labour theory of value proudhon s market anarchism
max stirner s egoism and herbert spencer s law of equal freedom tucker strongly supported the
individual s right to own the product of his or her labour as private property and
believed in a market economy for trading this property he argued that in a truly free
market system without the state the abundance of competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all
workers received the full value of their labor other one nine th century individualists included lysander
spooner stephen pearl andrews and victor yarros the first international mikhail bakunin one eight one four
one eight seven six in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight
twenty years later in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the
first international united some diverse european revolutionary currents including anarchism due to its genuine links to
active workers movements the international became signficiant from the start karl marx was a leading figure
in the international he was elected to every succeeding general council of the association the first
objections to marx came from the mutualists who opposed communism and statism shortly after mikhail bakunin
and his followers joined in one eight six eight the first international became polarised into two
camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads the clearest difference between the camps was
over strategy the anarchists around bakunin favoured in kropotkin s words direct economical struggle against capitalism
without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation at that time marx and his followers focused on
parliamentary activity bakunin characterised marx s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that if a marxist party
gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had
fought against in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the
two groups at the hague congress this is often cited as the origin of the conflict
between anarchists and marxists from this moment the social democratic and libertarian currents of socialism had
distinct organisations including rival internationals anarchist communism peter kropotkin proudhon and bakunin both opposed communism associating
it with statism however in the one eight seven zero s many anarchists moved away from
bakunin s economic thinking called collectivism and embraced communist concepts communists believed the means of production
should be owned collectively and that goods be distributed by need not labor an early anarchist
communist was joseph d jacque the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he
argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has
a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their
nature he announced his ideas in his us published journal le libertaire one eight five eight
one eight six one peter kropotkin often seen as the most important theorist outlined his economic
ideas in the conquest of bread and fields factories and workshops he felt co operation is
more beneficial than competition illustrated in nature in mutual aid a factor of evolution one eight
nine seven subsequent anarchist communists include emma goldman and alexander berkman many in the anarcho syndicalist
movements see below saw anarchist communism as their objective isaac puente s one nine three two
comunismo libertario was adopted by the spanish cnt as its manifesto for a post revolutionary society
some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property
was not consistent with liberty for example benjamin tucker whilst professing respect for kropotkin and publishing
his work described communist anarchism as pseudo anarchism propaganda of the deed johann most was an
outspoken advocate of violence anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent due mainly to
a number of high profile violent acts including riots assassinations insurrections and terrorism by some anarchists
some revolutionaries of the late one nine th century encouraged acts of political violence such as
bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism such actions have sometimes been
called propaganda by the deed one of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was johann
most who said the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation
of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion
most s preferred method of terrorism dynamite earned him the moniker dynamost however there is no
consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general mikhail bakunin and errico malatesta for
example wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings but at
the same time they denounced acts of individual terrorism malatesta in on violence and bakunin when
he refuted nechaev other anarchists sometimes identified as pacifist anarchists advocated complete nonviolence leo tolstoy whose
philosophy is often viewed as a form of christian anarchism see below was a notable exponent
of nonviolent resistance anarchism in the labour movement the red and black flag coming from the
experience of anarchists in the labour movement is particularly associated with anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalism was
an early two zero th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state
to institute a worker controlled society the movement pursued industrial actions such as general strike as
a primary strategy many anarcho syndicalists believed in anarchist communism though not all communists believed in
syndicalism after the one eight seven one repression french anarchism reemerged influencing the bourses de travails
of autonomous workers groups and trade unions from this movement the conf d ration g n
rale du travail general confederation of work cgt was formed in one eight nine five as
the first major anarcho syndicalist movement emile pataud and emile pouget s writing for the cgt
saw libertarian communism developing from a general strike after one nine one four the cgt moved
away from anarcho syndicalism due to the appeal of bolshevism french style syndicalism was a significant
movement in europe prior to one nine two one and remained a significant movement in spain
until the mid one nine four zero s the industrial workers of the world iww founded

usher in a stateless society in one nine two three one zero zero zero zero zero

politics with a membership of one five eight million in one nine three four the cnt
played a major role in the spanish civil war see also anarchism in spain syndicalists like
ricardo flores mag n were key figures in the mexican revolution latin american anarchism was strongly
influenced extending to the zapatista rebellion and the factory occupation movements in argentina in berlin in
one nine two two the cnt was joined with the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist
successor to the first international contemporary anarcho syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities
much smaller than in the one nine one zero s two zero s and three zero

syndicalist movements include the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation the revolutionary industrial

critics of anarcho syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are workerist and fail to
deal with economic life outside work post leftist critics such as bob black claim anarcho syndicalism
advocates oppressive social structures such as work and the workplace anarcho syndicalists in general uphold principles
of workers solidarity direct action and self management the russian revolution the russian revolution of one
nine one seven was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and
as a philosophy anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions many anarchists
initially supporting the bolshevik coup however the bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left
wing opposition a conflict which culminated in the one nine one eight kronstadt rebellion anarchists in
central russia were imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks in ukraine anarchists fought
in the civil war against both whites and bolsheviks within the makhnovshchina peasant army led by
nestor makhno expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman before leaving russia were amongst those
agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising both wrote classic
accounts of their experiences in russia aiming to expose the reality of bolshevik control for them
bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule had proved all too true the victory
of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage
to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist
parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the us
for example the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww began to realign themselves away
from anarchism and towards the communist international in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist
exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in
response to the structures of bolshevism their one nine two six manifesto known as the organisational
platform of the libertarian communists was supported by some communist anarchists though opposed by many others
the platform continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised
around its principles of theoretical unity tactical unity collective responsibility and federalism platformist groups today include
the workers solidarity movement in ireland the uk s anarchist federation and the late north eastern
federation of anarchist communists in the northeastern united states and bordering canada the fight against fascism
spain one nine three six members of the cnt construct armoured cars to fight against the
fascists in one of the collectivised factories in the one nine two zero s and one
nine three zero s the familiar dynamics of anarchism s conflict with the state were transformed
by the rise of fascism in europe in many cases european anarchists faced difficult choices should
they join in popular fronts with reformist democrats and soviet led communists against a common fascist
enemy luigi fabbri an exile from italian fascism was amongst those arguing that fascism was something
different fascism is not just another form of government which like all others uses violence it
is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable it represents the utmost
glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority in france where the fascists
came close to insurrection in the february one nine three four riots anarchists divided over a
united front policy in spain the cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance
and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory but in one nine
three six the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back
to power months later the ruling class responded with an attempted coup and the spanish civil
war one nine three six three nine was underway in reponse to the army rebellion an
anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of the major
city of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivized the land but
even before the eventual fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground
in a bitter struggle with the stalinists the cnt leadership often appeared confused and divided with
some members controversially entering the government stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident
marxists and anarchists since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists have been involved in
fighting the rise of neo fascist groups in germany and the united kingdom some anarchists worked
within militant anti fascist groups alongside members of the marxist left they advocated directly combating fascists
with physical force rather than relying on the state since the late one nine nine zero
s a similar tendency has developed within us anarchism see also anti racist action us anti
fascist action uk antifa religious anarchism leo tolstoy one eight two eight one nine one zero
most anarchist culture tends to be secular if not outright anti religious however the combination of
religious social conscience historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes and the compatibility of some interpretations of
religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism christian anarchists believe that there is no
higher authority than god and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches they believe
that jesus teachings were clearly anarchistic but were corrupted when christianity was declared the official religion
of rome christian anarchists who follow jesus directive to turn the other cheek are strict pacifists
the most famous advocate of christian anarchism was leo tolstoy author of the kingdom of god
is within you who called for a society based on compassion nonviolent principles and freedom christian
anarchists tend to form experimental communities they also occasionally resist taxation many christian anarchists are vegetarian
or vegan christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion s
birth as the early church exhibits many anarchistic tendencies such as communal goods and wealth by
aiming to obey utterly certain of the bible s teachings certain anabaptist groups of sixteenth century
europe attempted to emulate the early church s social economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it
as the only social structure capable of true obediance to jesus teachings and utterly rejected in
theory all earthly hierarchies and authority and indeed non anabaptists in general and violence as ungodly
such groups for example the hutterites typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to as their movements
stabalised more authoritarian social models chinese anarchism was most influential in the one nine two zero
s strands of chinese anarchism included tai xu s buddhist anarchism which was influenced by tolstoy
and the well field system neopaganism with its focus on the environment and equality along with
its often decentralized nature has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists one of the most
prominent is starhawk who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism anarchism and feminism emma goldman
early french feminists such as jenny d h ricourt and juliette adam criticised the mysogyny in
the anarchism of proudhon during the one eight five zero s anarcha feminism is a kind
of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society while
anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years its explicit formulation as anarcha feminism
dates back to the early seven zero s during the second wave feminist movement anarcha feminism
views patriarchy as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history thus the first form of
oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female anarcha feminists then conclude that if feminists
are against patriarchy they must also be against all forms of hierarchy and therefore must reject
the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism anarcho primitivists see the creation of gender roles
and patriarchy a creation of the start of civilization and therefore consider primitivism to also be
an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns eco feminism is often considered a feminist
variant of green anarchist feminist thought anarcha feminism is most often associated with early two zero
th century authors and theorists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre although even early
first wave feminist mary wollstonecraft held proto anarchist views and william godwin is often considered a
feminist anarchist precursor it should be noted that goldman and de cleyre though they both opposed
the state had opposing philosophies as de cleyre explains miss goldman is a communist i am
an individualist she wishes to destroy the right of property i wish to assert it i
make my war upon privilege and authority whereby the right of property the true right in
that which is proper to the individual is annihilated she believes that co operation would entirely
supplant competition i hold that competition in one form or another will always exist and that
it is highly desirable it should in the spanish civil war an anarcha feminist group free
women organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas in the modern day anarchist movement many
anarchists male or female consider themselves feminists and anarcha feminist ideas are growing the publishing of
quiet rumors an anarcha feminist reader has helped to spread various kinds of anti authoritarian and
anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement wendy mcelroy has popularized an individualist anarchism take on
feminism in her books articles and individualist feminist website anarcho capitalism murray rothbard one nine two
six one nine nine five anarcho capitalism is a predominantly united states based theoretical tradition that
desires a stateless society with the economic system of free market capitalism unlike other branches of
anarchism it does not oppose profit or capitalism consequently most anarchists do not recognise anarcho capitalism
as a form of anarchism murray rothbard s synthesis of classical liberalism and austrian economics was
germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho capitalist theory he defines anarcho capitalism in terms of
the non aggression principle based on the concept of natural law competiting theorists use egoism utilitarianism
used by david friedman or contractarianism used by jan narveson some minarchists such as ayn rand
robert nozick and robert a heinlein have influenced anarcho capitalism some anarcho capitalists along with some
right wing libertarian historians such as david hart and ralph raico considered similar philosophies existing prior
to rothbard to be anarcho capitalist such as those of gustave de molinari and auberon herbert
opponents of anarcho capitalists dispute these claims the place of anarcho capitalism within anarchism and indeed
whether it is a form of anarchism at all is highly controversial for more on this
debate see anarchism and anarcho capitalism anarchism and the environment since the late one nine seven
zero s anarchists in anglophone and european countries have been taking action for the natural environment
eco anarchists or green anarchists believe in deep ecology this is a worldview that embraces biodiversity
and sustainability eco anarchists often use direct action against what they see as earth destroying institutions
of particular importance is the earth first movement that takes action such as tree sitting another
important component is ecofeminism which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination
of women green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists
civilization itself primitivism is a predominantly western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre industrial
and usually pre agricultural society it develops a critique of industrial civilization in this critique technology
and development have alienated people from the natural world this philosophy develops themes present in the
political action of the luddites and the writings of jean jacques rousseau primitivism developed in the
context of the reclaim the streets earth first and the earth liberation front movements john zerzan
wrote that civilization not just the state would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved
anarcho primitivists point to the anti authoritarian nature of many primitive or hunter gatherer societies throughout
the world s history as examples of anarchist societies other branches and offshoots anarchism generates many
eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements since the western social formet in the one nine six
zero s and one nine seven zero s a number new of movements and schools have
appeared most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements
listed above hakim bey post left anarchy post left anarchy also called egoist anarchism seeks to
distance itself from the traditional left communists liberals social democrats etc and to escape the confines
of ideology in general post leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment
to contrary leftist movements and single issue causes anti war anti nuclear etc it calls for
a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist
milieu it often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other
broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of explicit hierarchy important

association mutual aid the network model and crucially the rejection of any idea that the end
justifies the means let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power
and then begin imposing one s vision at the point of a gun other issues conceptions
of an anarchist society many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of
regulating violence so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are
established anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state
many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the cause of chaos violence
and war anarchists argue that the state helps to create a monopoly on violence and uses
violence to advance elite interests much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would
handle criminality see also anarchism and society civil rights and cultural sovereignty black anarchism opposes the
existence of a state capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of color and favors a
non hierarchical organization of society theorists include ashanti alston lorenzo komboa ervin and sam mbah anarchist
people of color was created as a forum for non caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts
about racial issues within the anarchist movement particularly within the united states national anarchism is a
political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views its adherents propose
that those preventing ethnic groups or races from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted
anti racist action is not an anarchist group but many anarchists are involved it focuses on
publicly confronting racist agitators the zapatista movement of chiapas mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with
some anarchist proclivities neocolonialism and globalization nearly all anarchists oppose neocolonialism as an attempt to use
economic coercion on a global scale carried out through state institutions such as the world bank
world trade organization group of eight and the world economic forum globalization is an ambiguous term
that has different meanings to different anarchist factions most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism
and or cultural imperialism which they may see as related many are active in the anti
globalization movement others particularly anarcho capitalists use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division
of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene
parallel structures many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state supported institutions and outposts such
as food not bombs infoshops educational systems such as home schooling neighborhood mediation arbitration groups and
so on the idea is to create the structures for a new anti authoritarian society in
the shell of the old authoritarian one technology recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause
both easier to advance and more conceivable to people many people use the internet to form
on line communities intellectual property is undermined and a gift culture supported by sharing music files
open source programming and the free software movement these cyber communities include the gnu linux indymedia
and wiki some anarchists see information technology as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism some even
think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable see also crypto anarchism and cypherpunk pacifism some
anarchists consider pacifism opposition to war to be inherent in their philosophy anarcho pacifists take it
further and follow leo tolstoy s belief in non violence anarchists see war as an activity
in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power both domestically and in foreign lands
and subscribe to randolph bourne s view that war is the health of the state a
lot of anarchist activity has been anti war based parliamentarianism in general terms the anarchist ethos
opposes voting in elections because voting amounts to condoning the state voluntaryism is an anarchist school
of thought which emphasizes tending your own garden and neither ballots nor bullets the anarchist case
against voting is explained in the ethics of voting by george h smith also see voting
anarchists an oxymoron or what by joe peacott and writings by fred woodworth sectarianism most anarchist
schools of thought are to some degree sectarian there is often a difference of opinion within
each school about how to react to or interact with other schools some such as panarchists
believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and
compete some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction others see opportunities
for coalition building or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes see anarchism without adjectives criticisms
of anarchism main article criticisms of anarchism violence since anarchism has often been associated with violence
and destruction some people have seen it as being too violent on the other hand hand
frederick engels criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough a revolution is certainly the most authoritarian
thing there is it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will
upon the other part by means of rifles bayonets and cannon authoritarian means if such there
be at all and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain
it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the
reactionists would the paris commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use
of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois utopianism anarchism is often criticised as
unfeasible or plain utopian even by many who agree that it s a nice idea in
principle for example carl landauer in his book european socialism criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian
and holds that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he holds
that the belief that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however
it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism for
example some such as benjamin tucker advocate privately funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property
however other anarchists such as sir herbert read proudly accept the characterization utopian class character marxists
have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the petite bourgeoisie or perhaps
the lumpenproletariat see e g plekhanov for a marxist critique of one eight nine five anarchists
have also been characterised as spoilt middle class dilettantes most recently in relation to anti capitalist
protesters tacit authoritarianism in recent decades anarchism has been criticised by situationists post anarchists and others
of preserving tacitly statist authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade hypocrisy some critics point
to the sexist and racist views of some prominent anarchists notably proudhon and bakunin as examples
of hypocrisy inherent within anarchism while many anarchists however dismiss that the personal prejudices of one
nine th century theorists influence the beliefs of present day anarchists others criticise modern anarchism for
continuing to be eurocentric and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like proudhon on fascism through
groups like cercle proudhon anarcho capitalist bryan caplan argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected
fascist sympathizers by spanish anarchists in the spanish civil war was a form of illegitimate coercion
making the proffessed anarchists ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians alongside the communists and fascists
he also criticizes the willingness of the cnt to join the statist republican government during the
civil war and references stanley g payne s book on the franco regime which claims that
the cnt entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war cultural phenomena noam

culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists although some anarchists reject any

movements like the one still thriving in barcelona in catalonia militant resistance to neo nazi groups
in places like germany and the uprisings of autonomous marxism situationist and autonomist groups in france
and italy also helped to give popularity to anti authoritarian non capitalist ideas in various musical
styles anarchism rose in popularity most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has
been punk rock although in the modern age hip hop and folk music are also becoming
important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message in the uk this was associated with
the punk rock movement the band crass is celebrated for its anarchist and pacifist ideas the
dutch punk band the ex further exemplifies this expression for further details see anarcho punk see

anarchism forms of government political ideology entry points political theories social philosophy autism is classified as
a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction communication ability patterns of interests
and patterns of behavior although the specific etiology of autism is unknown many researchers suspect that
autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers and while there is disagreement about the
magnitude nature and mechanisms for such environmental factors researchers have found at least seven major genes
prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one
united states child in one six six however the national institute of mental health gives a
more conservative estimate of one in one zero zero zero for families that already have one
autistic child the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in
twenty diagnosis is based on a list of psychiatric criteria and a series of standardized clinical
tests may also be used autism may not be physiologically obvious a complete physical and neurological
evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism some now speculate that autism is not a
single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways by definition
autism must manifest delays in social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or
imaginative play with onset prior to age three years according to the diagnostic and statistical manual
of mental disorders the icd one zero also says that symptoms must manifest before the age
of three years there have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism for reasons
that are heavily debated by researchers in psychology and related fields within the scientific community some
children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can
fully participate in mainstream education and social events but there are lingering concerns that an absolute
cure from autism is impossible with current technology however many autistic children and adults who are
able to communicate at least in writing are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions and
see such conditions as part of who they are history dr hans asperger described a form
of autism in the one nine four zero s that later became known as asperger s
syndrome the word autism was first used in the english language by swiss psychiatrist eugene bleuler
in a one nine one two number of the american journal of insanity it comes from
the greek word for self however the classification of autism did not occur until the middle
of the twentieth century when in one nine four three psychiatrist dr leo kanner of the
johns hopkins hospital in baltimore reported on one one child patients with striking behavioral similarities and
introduced the label early infantile autism he suggested autism from the greek autos meaning self to
describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people although kanner s
first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal the nervous child almost
every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders
at the same time an austrian scientist dr hans asperger described a different form of autism
that became known as asperger s syndrome but the widespread recognition of asperger s work was
delayed by world war ii in germany and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn
t translated into english for almost five zero years the majority of his work wasn t
widely read until one nine nine seven thus these two conditions were described and are today
listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr fourth edition text
revision one as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd more often referred to today
as autism spectrum disorders asd all of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference
in communication skills social interactions and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior few clinicians today
solely use the dsm iv criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism which are based on
the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones many clinicians instead use an alternate means or
a combination thereof to more accurately determine a diagnosis terminology when referring to someone diagnosed with
autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used
instead this is referred to as person first terminology the autistic community generally prefers the term
autistic for reasons that are fairly controversial this article uses the term autistic see talk page
characteristics dr leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three there
is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic and physicians
will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis much of this is due to
the sensory system of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other
people since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non autistic and the degree
to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another nevertheless
professionals within pediatric care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to
initiate treatment as early as possible however some people do not believe in treatment for autism
either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can
do more harm than good social development typically developing infants are social beings early in life
they do such things as gaze at people turn toward voices grasp a finger and even
smile in contrast most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty
learning to engage in the give and take of everyday human interaction even in the first
few months of life many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and
