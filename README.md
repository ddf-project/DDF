Distributed DataFrame: Productivity = Power x Simplicity
For Big Data Scientists & Engineers

# DDF - Distributed DataFrame 

DDF aims to make Big Data easy yet powerful, by bringing together
the best ideas from R Data Science, RDBMS/SQL, and Big Data distributed
processing.

It exposes high-level abstractions like RDBMS tables,
SQL queries, data cleansing and transformations, machine-learning
algorithms, even collaboration and authentication, etc., while
hiding all the complexities of parallel distributed processing
and data handling.

DDF is a general abstraction that can be implemented on multiple
execution and data engines. We are providing a native implementation
on Apache Spark, as it is today the most expressive in its DAG
parallelization and also most powerful in its in-memory distributed
dataset abstraction (RDD). With this release, DDF provides native
Spark support for R, Python, Java, Scala.

An aim of the DDF project is to shine a focus of Big Data conversations
on top-down, user-focussed simplicity and power, where "users" include
business analysts, data scientists, and high-level Big Data engineers.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| bin | useful helper scripts |
| exe | DDF execution/launch scripts and executables |
| conf | DDF configuration files |
| R | DDF in R |
| python | DDF in python |
| core | DDF core API |
| spark | DDF Spark implementation |
| examples | DDF example API-user code |
| project | Scala build config files |

### Getting Started

First clone or fork a copy of DDF, e.g.:

```
$ git clone http://git.adatao.com/DDF 
```

Now you need to prepare the build, which prepares the libraries,
creates pom.xml in the various sub-project directories, and Eclipse
.project and .classpath files.

```
$ cd DDF
$ bin/run-once.sh
```

If you ever need to regenerated the pom.xml files:

```
$ bin/make-poms.sh
```

The following regenerates Eclipse .project and .classpath files:

```
$ bin/make-eclipse-projects.sh
```

### Building `DDF_core` or `DDF_spark`

```
$ (cd core ; mvn clean package)
$ (cd spark ; mvn clean package)
```

### Running tests
	
```
$ bin/sbt test
```

or

```
$ (cd core ; mvn test)
$ (cd spark ; mvn test)
```
