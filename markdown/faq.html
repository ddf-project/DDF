### DDF
1. What DDF is not ?
	* DDF is not a database that run SQL. 
	* DDF is not JUST a table. 
	* DDF is not JUST a RDD. 
	* DDF is not JUST a layer on top of Spark. 
	
2. What is good about DDF ?
	* DDF doesn’t require users to write map(), reduce(), collect(). DDF value is a higher level of abstraction and any time you go one level higher, two things occur: (a) you can do more by saying less, 
	and (b) you do give up arbitrary flexibility at the lower level. This is high productivity gains for developers. 
	* DDF is more than just applying analytic functions to big data. It also enables data sharing (collaboration) via URIs. 
	* DDF is also about providing a uniform API across different engines, of which Spark is only one.

### Java issues
1.Q: How do I fix OutOfMemory while building DDF ? 

A: DDF uses maven to build project, you can set MAVEN memory to higher values, for example: 
```sh
export MAVEN_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=128m
```


2.Q: I don't have Java on my machine, how to install Java 7 on Mac ? 

A: Apple and Oracle do not support Java 1.7 out of the box, you need to install <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8826881/maven-install-on-mac-os-x" target="_blank">manually</a>

3.Q: I have this error JAVA_HOME is not set properly, how to fix that ?

A: You need to set JAVA_HOME properly, for example: ```sh export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home` ```

4.Q: I saw this error message "You must build DDF's Java core and spark package firstly" 

A:You need to run ```bin/run-once.sh``` successfully.

### R issues
1.Q: How to fix ClassNotFound exception while using R-DDF ? 

A: R-DDF use rJava to invoke DDF Java class, make sure you're using Java 1.7, R 3.x and you have installed rJava. This error happens mostly on MacOS X. 

- First you need to set JAVA PATH properly, in Mac it looks something like this
```sh
JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/server
JAVA_LIBS='-L/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/server -ljvm' 
JAVA_CPPFLAGS='-I/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home/include -I/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home/include/darwin'
```

- Secondly
```
sh R CMD javareconf -e
```

- Then export 
```sh
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/server/
```

2.Q: I have this error while running ```R CMD javareconf -e```
> make: llvm-gcc-4.2: No such file or directory

A: This error occurs mostly on MacOSX. It happens because you can't install rJava. Please follow this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19533220/cannot-install-r-package-from-source-in-mac-osx-maverick" target="_blank">instruction</a>
